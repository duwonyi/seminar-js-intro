## A Pretty Brief History of JavaScript
- Netscape, Brendan Eich 
- In 1995
- Mocha -> LiveScript -> JavaScript
- JScript developed by Microsoft in 1996
- ECMAScript, ECMA-262, TC39, 1st in 1997
- 3rd in 1999, widely spread version.

## Objectives
- To become the web more dynamic
- Small scripting language to interact with the DOM
- For designers, non-developers 

## JavaScript and Java
- Sun wants Netscape to develope Java for Web.
- No time, developed for just 2 weeks
- Java-like Syntax, Scheme and Self
- Sun and Netscape deal, JavaScript

## Features
- Java-like Syntax
- Functions as First-Class Objects 
- Prototype-based Object Model
- Multi paradigm Language
- Host environment needed(window, global)
- Single Thread
- Easy to learn but hard to master

## [Browser Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
- 1st war: Netscape Navigator VS IE(1996-2001)
- Great revolution but many inconsistences, HTML and CSS
- 2nd war: IE vs Safari vs Firefox vs Chrome(2004-present)
- HTML5, CSS3, ECMAScript6
- JavaScript Engine Race: SpiderMonkey, V8, Nitro, Chakra 

## Renaissance: Ajax
- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- XMLHttpRequest introduced by Microsoft in IE5
- Perform an asynchronous HTTP request against a server
- Allow pages to be updated on-the-fly
- Google suggestions, Gmail, Google Maps 
- jQuery

## Present
- HTML5, CSS3
- V8, NodeJS, NPM
- Single Page Application(SPA)
- Backbone, Angular, React, Polymer
- RESTful API based on JSON
- Data Visualization
- AMP + Progressive Web
- RxJS, Redux Architecture

## ECMAScript 2016
- ECMAScript v4
- ECMAScript v6, ECMA2015, ECMA2016(v7)
- class, block scope, module system etc.
- Babel, Typescript, Webpack
- Shim, Polyfill

## Web Application example
- Classical example(Vanilla, jQuery) 
- Modern example(ES6, Webpack)

## The Future of JavaScript
- Machine Language for browser.
- Web Assembly(demo)
- Web component
